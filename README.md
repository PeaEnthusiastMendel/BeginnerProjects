# BeginnerProjects #  
---  
My way of tracking my progress at learning python 3, through completing projects on my Raspberry Pi (Model 3 B).
I'll host exercises, Projects, and snippets of code here. most will be Rasperry Pi centric, and wont work otherwise _(for example, my morse code display, which utilizes the Raspery Pi's GPIO pins)_.  
My project list, as well as a todo list of upcoming  projects and ways to improve older progframs is located at the Wiki. Enjoy!
