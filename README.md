# BeginnerProjects  

I'll host exercises, Projects, and snippets of code here. most will be Rasperry Pi centric, and wont work otherwise _(for example, my morse code display, which utilizes the Raspery Pi's GPIO pins)_.  

My project list, as well as a todo list of upcoming projects and ways to improve older programs is located at the Wiki. Enjoy!
